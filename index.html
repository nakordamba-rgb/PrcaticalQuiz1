            <p>
                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical universe,
                material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena
                of the physical world, and also to life in general. Manufactured objects
                and human interaction are, in common usage, not considered part of nature
                unless qualified in ways such as "human nature" or "the whole of nature".
                Nature is generally distinguished from the supernatural. It ranges in scale
                from the subatomic to the galactic.

            <h3 class="section-title">EARTH</h3>
            <p>
                Earth (or, "the earth")the fifth largest planet in the solar system, third
                in order of distance from the Sun. It is the largest of its planetary system's
                terrestrial planets and the only place in the universe known to support life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar
                regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical
                to subtropical region. Precipitation patterns vary widely according to location,
                ranging from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. About
                70 percent of the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists
                of continents and islands, with the vast majority of the inhabited land in the
                Northern Hemisphere.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title">LIFE</h3>
            <p>
                Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists
                generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by
                organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.
                Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.
